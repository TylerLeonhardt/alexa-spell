    peterRabbitBook: "Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names  were--              Flopsy,         Mopsy,     Cotton-tail,  and Peter.    They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a  very big fir-tree.    'Now my dears,' said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, 'you may go into  the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden:  your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs.  McGregor.'            'Now run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out.'    Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through  the wood to the baker's. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five  currant buns.            Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went  down the lane to gather blackberries:    But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's  garden, and squeezed under the gate!            First he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate  some radishes;    And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.            But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr.  McGregor!    Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages,  but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out,  'Stop thief!'            Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden,  for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.    He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe  amongst the potatoes.    After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I  think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately  run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his  jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.            Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were  overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great  excitement, and implored him to exert himself.    Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the  top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket  behind him.            And rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. It would have  been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.    Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the  tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn  them over carefully, looking under each.    Presently Peter sneezed--'Kertyschoo!' Mr. McGregor was after him in  no time.            And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window,  upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and  he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work.    Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with  fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was  very damp with sitting in that can.    After a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not  very fast, and looking all round.            He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room  for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.    An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying  peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to  the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not  answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.    Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he  became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr.  McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some  gold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her  tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away  without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin,  little Benjamin Bunny.            He went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him,  he heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.  Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing  happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over.  The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was  turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!    Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow; and started running  as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some  black-currant bushes.    Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not  care. He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood  outside the garden.            Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow  to frighten the blackbirds.    Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to  the big fir-tree.    He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the  floor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes. His mother was busy  cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the  second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a  fortnight!        I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.    His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a  dose of it to Peter!    'One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.'    But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and  blackberries for supper."
    , myFathersDragonBook: "One cold rainy day when my father was a little boy, he met an old  alley cat on his street. The cat was very drippy and uncomfortable so  my father said, 'Wouldn't you like to come home with me?  '    This surprised the cat--she had never before met anyone who cared  about old alley cats--but she said,   'I'd be very much obliged if I  could sit by a warm furnace, and perhaps have a saucer of milk.  '      'We have a very nice furnace to sit by,  ' said my father,   'and I'm sure  my mother has an extra saucer of milk.  '        My father and the cat became good friends but my father's mother was  very upset about the cat. She hated cats, particularly ugly old alley  cats.   'Elmer Elevator,  ' she said to my father,   'if you think I'm going  to give that cat a saucer of milk, you're very wrong. Once you start  feeding stray alley cats you might as well expect to feed every stray  in town, and I am _not_ going to do it!  '    This made my father very sad, and he apologized to the cat because his  mother had been so rude. He told the cat to stay anyway, and that  somehow he would bring her a saucer of milk each day. My father fed  the cat for three weeks, but one day his mother found the cat's saucer  in the cellar and she was extremely angry. She whipped my father and  threw the cat out the door, but later on my father sneaked out and  found the cat. Together they went for a walk in the park and tried to  think of nice things to talk about. My father said,   'When I grow up  I'm going to have an airplane. Wouldn't it be wonderful to fly just  anywhere you might think of!  '      'Would you like to fly very, very much?  ' asked the cat.      'I certainly would. I'd do anything if I could fly.  '          'Well,  ' said the cat,   'If you'd really like to fly that much, I think  I know of a sort of a way you might get to fly while you're still a  little boy.  '      'You mean you know where I could get an airplane?  '      'Well, not exactly an airplane, but something even better. As you can  see, I'm an old cat now, but in my younger days I was quite a  traveler. My traveling days are over but last spring I took just one  more trip and sailed to the Island of Tangerina, stopping at the port  of Cranberry. Well, it just so happened that I missed the boat, and  while waiting for the next I thought I'd look around a bit. I was  particularly interested in a place called Wild Island, which we had  passed on our way to Tangerina. Wild Island and Tangerina are joined  together by a long string of rocks, but people never go to Wild Island  because it's mostly jungle and inhabited by very wild animals. So, I  decided to go across the rocks and explore it for myself. It certainly  is an interesting place, but I saw something there that made me want  to weep.  '        'Wild Island is practically cut in two by a very wide and muddy  river,  ' continued the cat.   'This river begins near one end of the  island and flows into the ocean at the other. Now the animals there  are very lazy, and they used to hate having to go all the way around  the beginning of this river to get to the other side of the island.  It made visiting inconvenient and mail deliveries slow, particularly  during the Christmas rush. Crocodiles could have carried passengers  and mail across the river, but crocodiles are very moody, and not the  least bit dependable, and are always looking for something to eat.  They don't care if the animals have to walk around the river, so  that's just what the animals did for many years.  '      'But what does all this have to do with airplanes?  ' asked my father,  who thought the cat was taking an awfully long time to explain.      'Be patient, Elmer,  ' said the cat, and she went on with the story.    'One day about four months before I arrived on Wild Island a baby  dragon fell from a low-flying cloud onto the bank of the river. He was  too young to fly very well, and besides, he had bruised one wing quite  badly, so he couldn't get back to his cloud. The animals found him  soon afterwards and everybody said, 'Why, this is just exactly what  we've needed all these years!' They tied a big rope around his neck  and waited for the wing to get well. This was going to end all their  crossing-the-river troubles.  '          'I've never seen a dragon,  ' said my father.   'Did you see him? How big  is he?  '      'Oh, yes, indeed I saw the dragon. In fact, we became great friends,  '  said the cat.   'I used to hide in the bushes and talk to him when  nobody was around. He's not a very big dragon, about the size of a  large black bear, although I imagine he's grown quite a bit since I  left. He's got a long tail and yellow and blue stripes. His horn and  eyes and the bottoms of his feet are bright red, and he has  gold-colored wings.  '      'Oh, how wonderful!  ' said my father.   'What did the animals do with him  when his wing got well?  '      'They started training him to carry passengers, and even though he is  just a baby dragon, they work him all day and all night too sometimes.  They make him carry loads that are much too heavy, and if he  complains, they twist his wings and beat him. He's always tied to a  stake on a rope just long enough to go across the river. His only  friends are the crocodiles, who say 'Hello' to him once a week if they  don't forget. Really, he's the most miserable animal I've ever come  across. When I left I promised I'd try to help him someday, although I  couldn't see how. The rope around his neck is about the biggest,  toughest rope you can imagine, with so many knots it would take days  to untie them all.      'Anyway, when you were talking about airplanes, you gave me a good  idea. Now, I'm quite sure that if you were able to rescue the dragon,  which wouldn't be the least bit easy, he'd let you ride him most  anywhere, provided you were nice to him, of course. How about trying  it?  '      'Oh, I'd love to,  ' said my father, and he was so angry at his mother  for being rude to the cat that he didn't feel the least bit sad about  running away from home for a while.    That very afternoon my father and the cat went down to the docks to  see about ships going to the Island of Tangerina. They found out that  a ship would be sailing the next week, so right away they started  planning for the rescue of the dragon. The cat was a great help in  suggesting things for my father to take with him, and she told him  everything she knew about Wild Island. Of course, she was too old to  go along.    Everything had to be kept very secret, so when they found or bought  anything to take on the trip they hid it behind a rock in the park.  The night before my father sailed he borrowed his father's knapsack  and he and the cat packed everything very carefully. He took chewing  gum, two dozen pink lollipops, a package of rubber bands, black rubber  boots, a compass, a tooth brush and a tube of tooth paste, six  magnifying glasses, a very sharp jackknife, a comb and a hairbrush,  seven hair ribbons of different colors, an empty grain bag with a  label saying   'Cranberry,  ' some clean clothes, and enough food to last  my father while he was on the ship. He couldn't live on mice, so he  took twenty-five peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and six apples,  because that's all the apples he could find in the pantry.    When everything was packed my father and the cat went down to the  docks to the ship. A night watchman was on duty, so while the cat made  loud queer noises to distract his attention, my father ran over the  gang-plank onto the ship. He went down into the hold and hid among  some bags of wheat. The ship sailed early the next morning.      My father hid in the hold for six days and nights. Twice he was nearly  caught when the ship stopped to take on more cargo. But at last he  heard a sailor say that the next port would be Cranberry and that  they'd be unloading the wheat there. My father knew that the sailors  would send him home if they caught him, so he looked in his knapsack  and took out a rubber band and the empty grain bag with the label  saying   'Cranberry.  ' At the last moment my father got inside the bag,  knapsack and all, folded the top of the bag inside, and put the rubber  band around the top. He didn't look just exactly like the other bags  but it was the best he could do.        Soon the sailors came to unload. They lowered a big net into the hold  and began moving the bags of wheat. Suddenly one sailor yelled,   'Great  Scott! This is the queerest bag of wheat I've ever seen! It's all  lumpy-like, but the label says it's to go to Cranberry.  '    The other sailors looked at the bag too, and my father, who was in the  bag, of course, tried even harder to look like a bag of wheat. Then  another sailor felt the bag and he just happened to get hold of my  father's elbow.   'I know what this is,  ' he said.   'This is a bag of  dried corn on the cob,  ' and he dumped my father into the big net along  with the bags of wheat.    This all happened in the late afternoon, so late that the merchant in  Cranberry who had ordered the wheat didn't count his bags until the  next morning. (He was a very punctual man, and never late for dinner.)  The sailors told the captain, and the captain wrote down on a piece of  paper, that they had delivered one hundred and sixty bags of wheat and  one bag of dried corn on the cob. They left the piece of paper for  the merchant and sailed away that evening.    My father heard later that the merchant spent the whole next day  counting and recounting the bags and feeling each one trying to find  the bag of dried corn on the cob. He never found it because as soon as  it was dark my father climbed out of the bag, folded it up and put it  back in his knapsack. He walked along the shore to a nice sandy place  and lay down to sleep.        My father was very hungry when he woke up the next morning. Just as he  was looking to see if he had anything left to eat, something hit him  on the head. It was a tangerine. He had been sleeping right under a  tree full of big, fat tangerines. And then he remembered that this was  the Island of Tangerina. Tangerine trees grew wild everywhere. My  father picked as many as he had room for, which was thirty-one, and  started off to find Wild Island.    He walked and walked and walked along the shore, looking for the rocks  that joined the two islands. He walked all day, and once when he met a  fisherman and asked him about Wild Island, the fisherman began to  shake and couldn't talk for a long while. It scared him that much,  just thinking about it. Finally he said,   'Many people have tried to  explore Wild Island, but not one has come back alive. We think they  were eaten by the wild animals.  ' This didn't bother my father. He kept  walking and slept on the beach again that night.    It was beautifully clear the next day, and way down the shore my  father could see a long line of rocks leading out into the ocean, and  way, way out at the end he could just see a tiny patch of green. He  quickly ate seven tangerines and started down the beach.    It was almost dark when he came to the rocks, but there, way out in  the ocean, was the patch of green. He sat down and rested a while,  remembering that the cat had said,   'If you can, go out to the island  at night, because then the wild animals won't see you coming along the  rocks and you can hide when you get there.  ' So my father picked seven  more tangerines, put on his black rubber boots, and waited for dark.    It was a very black night and my father could hardly see the rocks  ahead of him. Sometimes they were quite high and sometimes the waves  almost covered them, and they were slippery and hard to walk on.  Sometimes the rocks were far apart and my father had to get a running  start and leap from one to the next.    After a while he began to hear a rumbling noise. It grew louder and  louder as he got nearer to the island. At last it seemed as if he was  right on top of the noise, and he was. He had jumped from a rock onto  the back of a small whale who was fast asleep and cuddled up between  two rocks. The whale was snoring and making more noise than a steam  shovel, so it never heard my father say,   'Oh, I didn't know that was  you!  ' And it never knew my father had jumped on its back by mistake.        For seven hours my father climbed and slipped and leapt from rock to  rock, but while it was still dark he finally reached the very last  rock and stepped off onto Wild Island.      The jungle began just beyond a narrow strip of beach; thick, dark,  damp, scary jungle. My father hardly knew where to go, so he crawled  under a wahoo bush to think, and ate eight tangerines. The first thing  to do, he decided, was to find the river, because the dragon was tied  somewhere along its bank. Then he thought,   'If the river flows into  the ocean, I ought to be able to find it quite easily if I just walk  along the beach far enough.  ' So my father walked until the sun rose  and he was quite far from the Ocean Rocks. It was dangerous to stay  near them because they might be guarded in the daytime. He found a  clump of tall grass and sat down. Then he took off his rubber boots  and ate three more tangerines. He could have eaten twelve but he  hadn't seen any tangerines on this island and he could not risk  running out of something to eat.    My father slept all that day and only woke up late in the afternoon  when he heard a funny little voice saying,   'Queer, queer, what a dear  little dock! I mean, dear, dear, what a queer little rock!  ' My father  saw a tiny paw rubbing itself on his knapsack. He lay very still and  the mouse, for it _was_ a mouse, hurried away muttering to itself,   'I  must smell tumduddy. I mean, I must tell somebody.  '        My father waited a few minutes and then started down the beach because  it was almost dark now, and he was afraid the mouse really would tell  somebody. He walked all night and two scary things happened. First, he  just had to sneeze, so he did, and somebody close by said,   'Is that  you, Monkey?  ' My father said,   'Yes.  ' Then the voice said,   'You must  have something on your back, Monkey,  ' and my father said   'Yes,  '  because he did. He had his knapsack on his back.   'What do you have on  your back, Monkey?  ' asked the voice.    My father didn't know what to say because what would a monkey have on  its back, and how would it sound telling someone about it if it did  have something? Just then another voice said,   'I bet you're taking  your sick grandmother to the doctor's.  ' My father said   'Yes  ' and  hurried on. Quite by accident he found out later that he had been  talking to a pair of tortoises.        The second thing that happened was that he nearly walked right between  two wild boars who were talking in low solemn whispers. When he  first saw the dark shapes he thought they were boulders. Just in time  he heard one of them say,   'There are three signs of a recent invasion.  First, fresh tangerine peels were found under the wahoo bush near the  Ocean Rocks. Second, a mouse reported an extraordinary rock some  distance from the Ocean Rocks which upon further investigation simply  wasn't there. However, more fresh tangerine peels were found in the  same spot, which is the third sign of invasion. Since tangerines do  not grow on our island, somebody must have brought them across the  Ocean Rocks from the other island, which may, or may not, have  something to do with the appearance and/or disappearance of the  extraordinary rock reported by the mouse.  '    After a long silence the other boar said,   'You know, I think we're  taking all this too seriously. Those peels probably floated over here  all by themselves, and you know how unreliable mice are. Besides, if  there had been an invasion, _I_ would have seen it!  '      'Perhaps you're right,  ' said the first boar.   'Shall we retire?  '  Whereupon they both trundled back into the jungle.    Well, that taught my father a lesson, and after that he saved all his  tangerine peels. He walked all night and toward morning came to the  river. Then his troubles really began.      The river was very wide and muddy, and the jungle was very gloomy and  dense. The trees grew close to each other, and what room there was  between them was taken up by great high ferns with sticky leaves. My  father hated to leave the beach, but he decided to start along the  river bank where at least the jungle wasn't quite so thick. He ate  three tangerines, making sure to keep all the peels this time, and put  on his rubber boots.    My father tried to follow the river bank but it was very swampy, and  as he went farther the swamp became deeper. When it was almost as deep  as his boot tops he got stuck in the oozy, mucky mud. My father tugged  and tugged, and nearly pulled his boots right off, but at last he  managed to wade to a drier place. Here the jungle was so thick that he  could hardly see where the river was. He unpacked his compass and  figured out the direction he should walk in order to stay near the  river. But he didn't know that the river made a very sharp curve away  from him just a little way beyond, and so as he walked straight ahead  he was getting farther and farther away from the river.    It was very hard to walk in the jungle. The sticky leaves of the ferns  caught at my father's hair, and he kept tripping over roots and rotten  logs. Sometimes the trees were clumped so closely together that he  couldn't squeeze between them and had to walk a long way around.    He began to hear whispery noises, but he couldn't see any animals  anywhere. The deeper into the jungle he went the surer he was that  something was following him, and then he thought he heard whispery  noises on both sides of him as well as behind. He tried to run, but  he tripped over more roots, and the noises only came nearer. Once or  twice he thought he heard something laughing at him.    At last he came out into a clearing and ran right into the middle of  it so that he could see anything that might try to attack him. Was he  surprised when he looked and saw fourteen green eyes coming out of the  jungle all around the clearing, and when the green eyes turned into  seven tigers! The tigers walked around him in a big circle, looking  hungrier all the time, and then they sat down and began to talk.      'I suppose you thought we didn't know you were trespassing in our  jungle!  '        Then the next tiger spoke.   'I suppose you're going to say you didn't  know it was our jungle!  '      'Did you know that not one explorer has ever left this island alive?  '  said the third tiger.    My father thought of the cat and knew this wasn't true. But of course  he had too much sense to say so. One doesn't contradict a hungry  tiger.    The tigers went on talking in turn.   'You're our first little boy, you  know. I'm curious to know if you're especially tender.  '          'Maybe you think we have regular meal-times, but we don't. We just eat  whenever we're feeling hungry,  ' said the fifth tiger.      'And we're very hungry right now. In fact, I can hardly wait,  ' said  the sixth.      'I _can't_ wait!  ' said the seventh tiger.        And then all the tigers said together in a loud roar,   'Let's begin  right now!  ' and they moved in closer.    My father looked at those seven hungry tigers, and then he had an  idea. He quickly opened his knapsack and took out the chewing gum. The  cat had told him that tigers were especially fond of chewing gum,  which was very scarce on the island. So he threw them each a piece but  they only growled,   'As fond as we are of chewing gum, we're sure we'd  like you even better!  ' and they moved so close that he could feel them  breathing on his face.      'But this is very special chewing gum,  ' said my father.   'If you keep  on chewing it long enough it will turn green, and then if you plant  it, it will grow more chewing gum, and the sooner you start chewing  the sooner you'll have more.  '    The tigers said,   'Why, you don't say! Isn't that fine!  ' And as each  one wanted to be the first to plant the chewing gum, they all  unwrapped their pieces and began chewing as hard as they could. Every  once in a while one tiger would look into another's mouth and say,    'Nope, it's not done yet,  ' until finally they were all so busy looking  into each other's mouths to make sure that no one was getting ahead  that they forgot all about my father.        My father soon found a trail leading away from the clearing. All sorts  of animals might be using it too, but he decided to follow the trail  no matter what he met because it might lead to the dragon. He kept a  sharp lookout in front and behind and went on.    Just as he was feeling quite safe, he came around a curve right behind  the two wild boars. One of them was saying to the other,   'Did you know  that the tortoises thought they saw Monkey carrying his sick  grandmother to the doctor's last night? But Monkey's grandmother died  a week ago, so they must have seen something else. I wonder what it  was.  '      'I told you that there was an invasion afoot,  ' said the other boar,    'and I intend to find out what it is. I simply can't stand invasions.  '      'Nee meither,  ' said a tiny little voice.   'I mean, me neither,  ' and my  father knew that the mouse was there, too.      'Well,  ' said the first boar,   'you search the trail up this way to the  dragon. I'll go back down the other way through the big clearing, and  we'll send Mouse to watch the Ocean Rocks in case the invasion should  decide to go away before we find it.  '        My father hid behind a mahogany tree just in time, and the first boar  walked right past him. My father waited for the other boar to get a  head start on him, but he didn't wait very long because he knew that  when the first boar saw the tigers chewing gum in the clearing, he'd  be even more suspicious.    Soon the trail crossed a little brook and my father, who by this time  was very thirsty, stopped to get a drink of water. He still had on his  rubber boots, so he waded into a little pool of water and was stooping  down when something quite sharp picked him up by the seat of the pants  and shook him very hard.      'Don't you know that's my private weeping pool?  ' said a deep angry  voice.    My father couldn't see who was talking because he was hanging in the  air right over the pool, but he said,   'Oh, no, I'm so sorry. I didn't  know that everybody had a private weeping pool.  '          'Everybody doesn't!  ' said the angry voice,   'but I do because I have  such a big thing to weep about, and I drown everybody I find using my  weeping pool.  ' With that the animal tossed my father up and down over  the water.      'What--is it--that--you--weep about--so much?  ' asked my father, trying  to get his breath, and he thought over all the things he had in his  pack.      'Oh, I have many things to weep about, but the biggest thing is the  color of my tusk.  ' My father squirmed every which way trying to see  the tusk, but it was through the seat of his pants where he couldn't  possibly see it.   'When I was a young rhinoceros, my tusk was pearly  white,  ' said the animal (and then my father knew that he was hanging  by the seat of his pants from a rhinoceros' tusk!),   'but it has turned  a nasty yellow-gray in my old age, and I find it very ugly. You see,  everything else about me is ugly, but when I had a beautiful tusk I  didn't worry so much about the rest. Now that my tusk is ugly too, I  can't sleep nights just thinking about how completely ugly I am, and I  weep all the time. But why should I be telling you these things? I  caught you using my pool and now I'm going to drown you.  '      'Oh, wait a minute, Rhinoceros,  ' said my father.   'I have some things  that will make your tusk all white and beautiful again. Just let me  down and I'll give them to you.  '    The rhinoceros said,   'You do? I can hardly believe it! Why, I'm so  excited!  ' He put my father down and danced around in a circle while my  father got out the tube of tooth paste and the toothbrush.      'Now,  ' said my father,   'just move your tusk a little nearer, please,  and I'll show you how to begin.  ' My father wet the brush in the pool,  squeezed on a dab of tooth paste, and scrubbed very hard in one tiny  spot. Then he told the rhinoceros to wash it off, and when the pool  was calm again, he told the rhinoceros to look in the water and see  how white the little spot was. It was hard to see in the dim light of  the jungle, but sure enough, the spot shone pearly white, just like  new. The rhinoceros was so pleased that he grabbed the toothbrush and  began scrubbing violently, forgetting all about my father.    Just then my father heard hoofsteps and he jumped behind the  rhinoceros. It was the boar coming back from the big clearing where  the tigers were chewing gum. The boar looked at the rhinoceros, and at  the toothbrush, and at the tube of tooth paste, and then he scratched  his ear on a tree.   'Tell me, Rhinoceros,  ' he said,   'where did you get  that fine tube of tooth paste and that toothbrush?  '      'Too busy!  ' said the rhinoceros, and he went on brushing as hard as he  could.    The boar sniffed angrily and trotted down the trail toward the dragon,  muttering to himself,   'Very suspicious--tigers too busy chewing gum,  Rhinoceros too busy brushing his tusk--must get hold of that  invasion. Don't like it one bit, not one bit! It's upsetting everybody  terribly--wonder what it's doing here, anyway.  '        My father waved goodbye to the rhinoceros, who was much too busy to  notice, got a drink farther down the brook, and waded back to the  trail. He hadn't gone very far when he heard an angry animal roaring,    'Ding blast it! I told you not to go blackberrying yesterday. Won't  you ever learn? What will your mother say!  '    My father crept along and peered into a small clearing just ahead. A  lion was prancing about clawing at his mane, which was all snarled and  full of blackberry twigs. The more he clawed the worse it became and  the madder he grew and the more he yelled at himself, because it was  himself he was yelling at all the time.    My father could see that the trail went through the clearing, so he  decided to crawl around the edge in the underbrush and not disturb the  lion.    He crawled and crawled, and the yelling grew louder and louder. Just  as he was about to reach the trail on the other side the yelling  suddenly stopped. My father looked around and saw the lion glaring at  him. The lion charged and skidded to a stop a few inches away.          'Who are you?  ' the lion yelled at my father.      'My name is Elmer Elevator.  '      'Where do you think you're going?  '      'I'm going home,  ' said my father.      'That's what you think!  ' said the lion.   'Ordinarily I'd save you for  afternoon tea, but I happen to be upset enough and hungry enough to  eat you right now.  ' And he picked up my father in his front paws to  feel how fat he was.    My father said,   'Oh, please, Lion, before you eat me, tell me why you  are so particularly upset today.  '      'It's my mane,  ' said the lion, as he was figuring how many bites a  little boy would make.   'You see what a dreadful mess it is, and I  don't seem to be able to do anything about it. My mother is coming  over on the dragon this afternoon, and if she sees me this way I'm  afraid she'll stop my allowance. She can't stand messy manes! But I'm  going to eat you now, so it won't make any difference to you.  '      'Oh, wait a minute,  ' said my father,   'and I'll give you just the  things you need to make your mane all tidy and beautiful. I have them  here in my pack.  '      'You do?  ' said the lion.   'Well, give them to me, and perhaps I'll save  you for afternoon tea after all,  ' and he put my father down on the  ground.    My father opened the pack and took out the comb and the brush and the  seven hair ribbons of different colors.   'Look,  ' he said,   'I'll show  you what to do on your forelock, where you can watch me. First you  brush a while, and then you comb, and then you brush again until all  the twigs and snarls are gone. Then you divide it up in three and  braid it like this and tie a ribbon around the end.  '    As my father was doing this, the lion watched very carefully and began  to look much happier. When my father tied on the ribbon he was all  smiles.   'Oh, that's wonderful, really wonderful!  ' said the lion.   'Let  me have the comb and brush and see if I can do it.  ' So my father gave  him the comb and brush and the lion began busily grooming his mane. As  a matter of fact, he was so busy that he didn't even know when my  father left.      My father was very hungry so he sat down under a baby banyan tree on  the side of the trail and ate four tangerines. He wanted to eat eight  or ten, but he had only thirteen left and it might be a long time  before he could get more. He packed away all the peels and was about  to get up when he heard the familiar voices of the boars.      'I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen them with my own eyes,  but wait and see for yourself. All the tigers are sitting around  chewing gum to beat the band. Old Rhinoceros is so busy brushing his  tusk that he doesn't even look around to see who's going by, and  they're all so busy they won't even talk to me!  '          'Horsefeathers!  ' said the other boar, now very close to my father.    'They'll talk to me! I'm going to get to the bottom of this if it's  the last thing I do!  '    The voices passed my father and went around a curve, and he hurried on  because he knew how much more upset the boars would be when they saw  the lion's mane tied up in hair ribbons.        Before long my father came to a crossroads and he stopped to read the  signs. Straight ahead an arrow pointed to the Beginning of the River;  to the left, the Ocean Rocks; and to the right, to the Dragon Ferry.  My father was reading all these signs when he heard pawsteps and  ducked behind the signpost. A beautiful lioness paraded past and  turned down toward the clearings. Although she could have seen my  father if she had bothered to glance at the post, she was much too  occupied looking dignified to see anything but the tip of her own  nose. It was the lion's mother, of course, and that, thought my  father, must mean that the dragon was on this side of the river. He  hurried on but it was farther away than he had judged. He finally came  to the river bank in the late afternoon and looked all around, but  there was no dragon anywhere in sight. He must have gone back to the  other side.    My father sat down under a palm tree and was trying to have a good  idea when something big and black and hairy jumped out of the tree and  landed with a loud crash at his feet.      'Well?  ' said a huge voice.      'Well what?  ' said my father, for which he was very sorry when he  looked up and discovered he was talking to an enormous and very fierce  gorilla.      'Well, explain yourself,  ' said the gorilla.   'I'll give you till ten to  tell me your name, business, your age and what's in that pack,  ' and  he began counting to ten as fast as he could.        My father didn't even have time to say   'Elmer Elevator, explorer  '  before the gorilla interrupted,   'Too slow! I'll twist your arms the  way I twist that dragon's wings, and then we'll see if you can't hurry  up a bit.  ' He grabbed my father's arms, one in each fist, and was just  about to twist them when he suddenly let go and began scratching his  chest with both hands.      'Blast those fleas!  ' he raged.   'They won't give you a moment's peace,  and the worst of it is that you can't even get a good look at them.  Rosie! Rhoda! Rachel! Ruthie! Ruby! Roberta! Come here and get rid of  this flea on my chest. It's driving me crazy!  '    Six little monkeys tumbled out of the palm tree, dashed to the  gorilla, and began combing the hair on his chest.      'Well,  ' said the gorilla,   'it's still there!  '      'We're looking, we're looking,  ' said the six little monkeys,   'but  they're awfully hard to see, you know.  '          'I know,  ' said the gorilla,   'but hurry. I've got work to do,  ' and he  winked at my father.      'Oh, Gorilla,  ' said my father,   'in my knapsack I have six magnifying  glasses. They'd be just the thing for hunting fleas.  ' My father  unpacked them and gave one to Rosie, one to Rhoda, one to Rachel, one  to Ruthie, one to Ruby, and one to Roberta.          'Why, they're miraculous!  ' said the six little monkeys.   'It's easy to  see the fleas now, only there are hundreds of them!  ' And they went on  hunting frantically.    A moment later many more monkeys appeared out of a near-by clump of  mangroves and began crowding around to get a look at the fleas through  the magnifying glasses. They completely surrounded the gorilla, and he  could not see my father nor did he remember to twist his arms.        My father walked back and forth along the bank trying to think of some  way to cross the river. He found a high flagpole with a rope going  over to the other side. The rope went through a loop at the top of the  pole and then down the pole and around a large crank. A sign on the  crank said:    TO SUMMON DRAGON, YANK THE CRANK  REPORT DISORDERLY CONDUCT  TO GORILLA    From what the cat had told my father, he knew that the other end of  the rope was tied around the dragon's neck, and he felt sorrier than  ever for the poor dragon. If he were on this side, the gorilla would  twist his wings until it hurt so much that he'd have to fly to the  other side. If he were on the other side, the gorilla would crank the  rope until the dragon would either choke to death or fly back to this  side. What a life for a baby dragon!    My father knew that if he called to the dragon to come across the  river, the gorilla would surely hear him, so he thought about climbing  the pole and going across on the rope. The pole was very high, and  even if he could get to the top without being seen he'd have to go all  the way across hand over hand. The river was very muddy, and all sorts  of unfriendly things might live in it, but my father could think of no  other way to get across. He was about to start up the pole when,  despite all the noise the monkeys were making, he heard a loud splash  behind him. He looked all around in the water but it was dusk now, and  he couldn't see anything there.      'It's me, Crocodile,  ' said a voice to the left.   'The water's lovely,  and I have such a craving for something sweet. Won't you come in for a  swim?  '        A pale moon came out from behind the clouds and my father could see  where the voice was coming from. The crocodile's head was just peeping  out of the water.      'Oh, no thank you,  ' said my father.   'I never swim after sundown, but I  do have something sweet to offer you. Perhaps you'd like a lollipop,  and perhaps you have friends who would like lollipops, too?  '      'Lollipops!  ' said the crocodile.   'Why, that is a treat! How about it,  boys?  '    A whole chorus of voices shouted,   'Hurrah! Lollipops!  ' and my father  counted as many as seventeen crocodiles with their heads just peeping  out of the water.      'That's fine,  ' said my father as he got out the two dozen pink  lollipops and the rubber bands.   'I'll stick one here in the bank.  Lollipops last longer if you keep them out of the water, you know.  Now, one of you can have this one.  '    The crocodile who had first spoken swam up and tasted it.   'Delicious,  mighty delicious!  ' he said.      'Now if you don't mind,  ' said my father,   'I'll just walk along your  back and fasten another lollipop to the tip of your tail with a  rubber band. You don't mind, do you?  '          'Oh no, not in the least,  ' said the crocodile.      'Can you get your tail out of the water just a bit?  ' asked my father.      'Yes, of course,  ' said the crocodile, and he lifted up his tail. Then  my father ran along his back and fastened another lollipop with a  rubber band.      'Who's next?  ' said my father, and a second crocodile swam up and began  sucking on that lollipop.      'Now, you gentlemen can save a lot of time if you just line up across  the river,  ' said my father,   'and I'll be along to give you each a  lollipop.  '    So the crocodiles lined up right across the river with their tails in  the air, waiting for my father to fasten on the rest of the lollipops.  The tail of the seventeenth crocodile just reached the other bank.      When my father was crossing the back of the fifteenth crocodile with  two more lollipops to go, the noise of the monkeys suddenly stopped,  and he could hear a much bigger noise getting louder every second.  Then he could hear seven furious tigers and one raging rhinoceros and  two seething lions and one ranting gorilla along with countless  screeching monkeys, led by two extremely irate wild boars, all  yelling,   'It's a trick! It's a trick! There's an invasion and it must  be after our dragon. Kill it! Kill it!  ' The whole crowd stampeded down  to the bank.    As my father was fixing the seventeenth lollipop for the last  crocodile he heard a wild boar scream,   'Look, it came this way! It's  over there now, see! The crocodiles made a bridge for it,  ' and just as  my father leapt onto the other bank one of the wild boars jumped onto  the back of the first crocodile. My father didn't have a moment to  spare.        By now the dragon realized that my father was coming to rescue him. He  ran out of the bushes and jumped up and down yelling.   'Here I am! I'm  right here! Can you see me? Hurry, the boar is coming over on the  crocodiles, too. They're all coming over! Oh, please hurry, hurry!  '  The noise was simply terrific.    My father ran up to the dragon, and took out his very sharp jackknife.    'Steady, old boy, steady. We'll make it. Just stand still,  ' he told  the dragon as he began to saw through the big rope.    By this time both boars, all seven tigers, the two lions, the  rhinoceros, and the gorilla, along with the countless screeching  monkeys, were all on their way across the crocodiles and there was  still a lot of rope to cut through.      'Oh, hurry,  ' the dragon kept saying, and my father again told him to  stand still.      'If I don't think I can make it,  ' said my father,   'we'll fly over to  the other side of the river and I can finish cutting the rope there.  '        Suddenly the screaming grew louder and madder and my father thought  the animals must have crossed the river. He looked around, and saw  something which surprised and delighted him. Partly because he had  finished his lollipop, and partly because, as I told you before,  crocodiles are very moody and not the least bit dependable and are  always looking for something to eat, the first crocodile had turned  away from the bank and started swimming down the river. The second  crocodile hadn't finished yet, so he followed right after the first,  still sucking his lollipop. All the rest did the same thing, one right  after the other, until they were all swimming away in a line. The two  wild boars, the seven tigers, the rhinoceros, the two lions, the  gorilla, along with the countless screeching monkeys, were all riding  down the middle of the river on the train of crocodiles sucking pink  lollipops, and all yelling and screaming and getting their feet wet.        My father and the dragon laughed themselves weak because it was such a  silly sight. As soon as they had recovered, my father finished cutting  the rope and the dragon raced around in circles and tried to turn a  somersault. He was the most excited baby dragon that ever lived. My  father was in a hurry to fly away, and when the dragon finally calmed  down a bit my father climbed up onto his back.      'All aboard!  ' said the dragon.   'Where shall we go?  '      'We'll spend the night on the beach, and tomorrow we'll start on the  long journey home. So, it's off to the shores of Tangerina!  ' shouted  my father as the dragon soared above the dark jungle and the muddy  river and all the animals bellowing at them and all the crocodiles  licking pink lollipops and grinning wide grins. After all, what did  the crocodiles care about a way to cross the river, and what a fine  feast they were carrying on their backs!    As my father and the dragon passed over the Ocean Rocks they heard a  tiny excited voice scream,   'Bum cack! Bum cack! We dreed our nagon! I  mean, we need our dragon!  '    But my father and the dragon knew that nothing in the world would ever  make them go back to Wild Island.  "
    , benjaminBunnyBook: "One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.  He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.  A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.  As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.      That wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.  Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar). She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).  Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.  He came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter.      Peter was sitting by himself. He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.  'Peter,' said little Benjamin, in a whisper, 'who has got your clothes?'  Peter replied, 'The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,' and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.  Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.      Peter said he hoped that it would rain.  At this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: 'Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!'  Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.  They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden. Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.      Little Benjamin said: 'It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree.'  Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.  It had been sown with lettuces.  They left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.      Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief.  They took them off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.  Benjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.  Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his Aunt.  Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.       Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf. He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.  (The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)  The lettuces certainly were very fine.  Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. Presently he dropped half the onions.      Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.  The mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.  Presently Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.      They got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. Peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!  He was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.  This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!  Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket....      The cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.  Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!  Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.  She sat there for _five hours_.  I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.  The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.      At length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.  The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.  He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.  He was looking for his son.  Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.  He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.  The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.      When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.  Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.  Then he took out his nephew Peter.  Then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.    When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.  It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!  Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up _inside_ the greenhouse, locking the door upon the _outside_.      When Peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit-tobacco."
